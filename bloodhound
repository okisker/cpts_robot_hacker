To integrate SharpHound collection in your Python script with run_with_timeout_skip:
Assuming you are executing SharpHound from a command line (like on a Windows machine or a remote host via an agent), here’s how you might do it:

python
Copy
Edit
def run_bloodhound_collection(collection_method="All", timeout=600):
    """
    Run SharpHound BloodHound data collection with timeout.

    Args:
        collection_method (str): SharpHound collection method (e.g., 'All', 'Session', 'ACL').
        timeout (int): Timeout for the collector run in seconds.

    Returns:
        str: Result or timeout/error message.
    """

    # Example command for SharpHound execution - adjust path/command as needed
    # SharpHound.exe supports flags like -CollectionMethod All, -Domain example.com, etc.
    cmd = f"SharpHound.exe -CollectionMethod {collection_method}"

    out, err = run_with_timeout_skip(cmd, timeout)

    if err:
        return f"Error or timeout running BloodHound collection: {err}"
    else:
        return f"BloodHound collection completed:\n{out}"

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(run_bloodhound_collection("All", timeout=900))
Notes:
You must have SharpHound.exe accessible from where the script runs.

You can customize parameters for domain, output directory, and collection method.

If running remotely, you may need to trigger SharpHound through a remote command execution method (like WinRM, PSExec, or an agent).

After collection, you’d typically ingest the .zip files into BloodHound GUI or via the BloodHound API, which can be scripted but is more complex.
